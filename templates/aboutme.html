      Duke University's Memory for Movement Lab. Dr. Ruth S. Day was my principal 
      investigator, and I worked with a small team of fellow students to conduct 
      an experiment on volunteer dancers from the 2019 American Dance Festival.

      and power tools as well as paint and plaster.</dd>

    <dt>Assistant Teacher: Dance Dynamics, Wake Forest, NC (September-November 2018)</dt>
    <dd>I worked with children of diverse ages (4-17 y.o.), supported instructorsâ€™ 
      teaching style by deferring/adjusting to their preferred methods, and learned

       ensured that students followed safety rules within the studio, demonstrated 
       movement for students, provided additional assistance for dancers who had 
       difficulty learning, disciplined students as required, handled technical 
       aspects of classroom music (e.g. changing/selecting songs, selecting 
       particular time stamps to play at, adjusting volume, etc.). Students went 
       on to learn a full dance piece and performed in the yearly recital.</dd>
    
    <dt>Youth in Government Advisory Board Member: Town of Wake Forest, Wake Forest, NC (August 2016-Jun 2017)</dt>

      college professors and peers.</dd>
